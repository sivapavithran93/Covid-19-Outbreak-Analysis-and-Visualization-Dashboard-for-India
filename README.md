# Covid-19-Outbreak-Analysis-and-Visualization-Dashboard-for-India

  - Created a comprehensive dashboard to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data in India, providing actionableinsights for stakeholders to track the spread of the pandemic and inform their response.
## Key Achievements

  1) Comprehensive Dashboard Development:
        - Created a comprehensive and interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data in India.
        - Integrated multiple datasets related to Covid-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccinations, and testing details.

  2) Geospatial Analysis:
        - Developed a map visualization to show "Total Deaths by State," enabling stakeholders to identify high-risk areas.
        - Used geospatial analysis to track the spread of the pandemic across different states.

  3) Demographic Insights:
        - Created doughnut charts to display "Age Group Details" and "Gender Without Missing Values," providing insights into how different demographic groups were affected.
        - Analyzed these demographics to understand vulnerability and target interventions.

  4) Time Series Analysis:
        - Designed a multiple line chart to visualize "Covid-19 Cases by State - All" (confirmed, cured, deaths), allowing stakeholders to track trends over time.
        - Identified peaks and troughs in case numbers to inform public health responses.

  5) Vaccination Tracking:
        - Developed bar graphs to compare "First Dose Vs Second Dose Administrated" and "Doses Administrated by Vaccine," enabling the monitoring of vaccination progress.
        - Tracked vaccination rates to identify areas needing targeted vaccination campaigns.

  6) Testing Details:
        - Created bar charts for "Statewise Testing Details" and "ICMR Testing Labs in Each State," providing insights into testing capacity and coverage.
        - Identified states with low testing rates or limited lab capacity for targeted resource allocation.


## Insights

  1) Hotspot Identification:
        - Identified states with high death rates using the map visualization, which helped in targeting resource allocation and public health interventions.

  2) Demographic Vulnerability:
        - Analyzed age group details and gender distribution to understand which demographic groups were most vulnerable to Covid-19.
        - Identified areas where targeted interventions could be implemented based on demographic insights.

  3) Trend Analysis:
        - Tracked trends in confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths over time using the multiple line chart.
        - Predicted future outbreaks based on historical trends and informed public health responses accordingly.

  4) Vaccination Impact:
        - Compared first dose vs second dose administration rates to understand vaccination progress.
        - Identified regions with low vaccination rates that needed targeted campaigns.

  5) Testing Capacity Insights:
        - Analyzed statewise testing details to identify areas with low testing rates or limited lab capacity.
        - Informed resource allocation decisions based on testing capacity insights.

  6) Gender Disparities:
        - Used doughnut charts to analyze gender distribution without missing values, revealing any disparities in how men and women were affected by Covid-19.

  7) Vaccine Efficacy Insights:
        - Compared doses administered by different vaccines to understand their relative efficacy and distribution.
        - Informed vaccine procurement decisions based on these insights.
